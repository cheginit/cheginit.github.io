# Taher Chegini

I am a PhD Candidate at the University of Houston, Texas. My main research focus is
large-scale urban hydrology modeling. I am passionate about and an advocate for open
source software and open science. I have developed several open source Python libraries
that are available on [Github](https://github.com/cheginit).
