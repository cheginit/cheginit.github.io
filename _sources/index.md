# Introduction

I am a PhD Candidate at the University of Houston, Texas. My primary research focus is
on large-scale urban hydrological modeling. I am passionate about and an advocate for
open-source software and open-science. I have developed several open-source Python libraries
that are available on [Github](https://github.com/cheginit).
