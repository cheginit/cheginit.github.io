# Introduction

I am a postdoc at Purdue University. My primary research focus is
on large-scale urban hydrological modeling, synthetic river bathymetry
generation, and flood assessment. I am passionate about and an advocate for
open-source software and open-science. I have developed several open-source
Python libraries that are available on [Github](https://github.com/cheginit).
